Three months. Three months without publishing anything. New year was starting quite poorly. Even more so, after Raglan, I had lost motivation for shooting. Things have changed a lot since then."

Disgusted.

Today, I'm disgusted. I woke up, was packed with energy, and, received that email from UnderTheRadar. Suddenly felt like destroying something with a baseball bat. Haters gonna hate. Here's my tuesday's first world problem. 

undertheradar.co.nz is a major actor in the music news and gig ticket sales industry in New Zealand. Most of my friends here know that I have a passion for photography. So much that I've started a small (tiny!) business out of it, 9 months ago. Nothing crazy, but it's a thrilling experience.

I've met amazing people. I've had tremendous feedback. I've spent long nights editing sets because I couldn't wait for my customers and sometimes friends to see the results. I got high, almost entered trance states when I was shooting. Nothing else but lights, shapes, movements, and that little box in my hands I was using to fix all the beauty I was seeing through my viewfinder.

And I started shooting gigs. I was testing a lens, one evening, and was offered to join my good friends for a drink at a Tiny Ruins show. http://www.tinyruins.com. 

It was another of those few beautiful moments that took me by surprise. Time disappeared. I just kept shooting. And shooting. And listening. And shooting again. 

The night ended. On the way out, I had a word with this other photographer who told me he was working from times to times for undertheradar. Cool. "I'll check".

I went straight back to my place and started editing the set. I was quite happy with the result. Of course, I bought the lens the next day. But I also sent an email to undertheradar and shared a preview of what I had shot that night. Feedback was great, and once I finished editing (here's my selection: vaevictis.smugmug.com/V2/tiny-ruins-and-french-for/29517177_dWhhqD), I was positively surprised to discover that I got my first publication on a national media. The photos are still online:

From that point, things went wrong.

Just to give a bit of context, I work for free. I get free gig entries, but that's all. About 3 hours of shooting, at least the same time editing, for free. I get a bit of public coverage, sometimes, but that's all. I'm not complaining about money, though. I understand that no one gets particularly rich by playing music today, so that's quite fair I don't get a share of something that simply doesn't exist.

But, from the moment I started interacting with the so-called "general busybody", I felt something was not right. They are the one and only people that rudely asked me for silly deadlines. Shot a gig which finished at 1am a thursday, received that email about providing the images before friday noon. Well, what about my daily job, the one that, you know, pays the bills? Did my best, very little sleep, lunch spent editing, got the photos out by 2 pm. 

Never published.
No explanation. No thank word. Nada. 

Here are the images if anyone's curious: http://vaevictis.smugmug.com/V2/2013-06-13-ghost-wave-at/29977629_KXKTN7. Ghost wave and Soviet space dogs were great, I enjoyed the evening, the photos, and I saved 5$. Contrary to what I was told beforehands, my name was on no entry list. Things don't seem to connect between what I read in a email and what happens in real life. But, well, that's quite common so not complaining either. Just sayin'

This entry list thing happened again the next gig I covered. I went shooting Tokimonsta, a somewhat famous californian electronic music artist. No photographer from undertheradar name on the list, of course. A bit of patience, a few phone calls which didn't result in anything, a bit of polite discussion and I was finally in. With a seriously bitter taste in my mouth. Yeah, got published a second time. Images ended up being too dark on the website, but whatever, my bad. Some of them are visible here: https://www.facebook.com/guillaume.hammadi/mednia_set?set=a.10200868656231176.1073741834.1607628409&type=3

Got a good, long, break overseas. Came back to New Zealand. Didn't really know what I would do about those gig shootings. Thanks to this morning email, I know.

In the latest weekly email for gigs list they want covered (the Auckland one, by the way, I'm in Wellington but geography doesn't seem to be a concern for some), photographers are asked to change the way images are watermarked. 

I quote, because it's too damn funny.

"we ask that when watermarking your images you just use your name in Arial, rather than a fancy watermark of some kind"

If you ask, there's no back link of any sort on that website. Some photographers have a profile page, but there's not even a way to contact them. So, the only thing we, as photographers, had left, was this watermark. And, it's not a little fancy piece of text. It's part of the brand building strategy. It's the signature on the back of a painting. It's what I want to be, as a creative person.

Guitarists, please, play with only 2 strings of your gutar.
Graphic designers, stop using yellow and pink in your creations.

Seriously, Waaaat?

So, undertheradar, go to hell with your fancy watermarks of some kind. Fuck the insulting requests. Fuck the impossible deadlines. Fuck your inability to get your work done properly. Fuck you.
