Highly motivating day at the office ! <br /> <br /> After a mountain biking week-end with much sun (not that original, one would think), going back to work is quite difficult.

Not getting tired by a long lasting project is quite a challenge. There's a clear lassitude in diving in yet again the same dirty code, knowing that it will still be there tomorrow.
