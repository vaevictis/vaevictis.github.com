Canandian ambassy has opened its doors for Working Holiday Permits. <br /> The countdown has started. <br />
A few months ago, I went to Vancouver. Marie had been there for 2 months and invited me to stay in her place. What else could I do than buying those plane tickets and racing there ?
Well, starting to think a bit more seriously about this spend-a-year-abroad idea of mine.
<br />
<br />
Actually, I did both. I went there, spent 2 weeks discovering Vancouver, huge snow conditions in Whistler, asian food and rainy days. I went to Tofino, tryied to bathe in the freezing pacific ocean, changed my mind instantaneously (it was March and I didn't have a wetsuit) and enjoyed a salmon fish an chips watching the setting sun.
I walked along wooden pathways in these incredible rain forests, thinking how small I was when passing around big trees...

It was extraordinary.

But I already knew it would'nt stop at the end of the stay.
<br />
Back in France in April. Ok. Working Holiday Permits will only reopen in 8 months. Enough time to prepare for it.
<br />
<br />
Since then, I sold one of my mountain bikes, gave away my car, got rid of an aging PC, found people to take care of my furniture. I cleaned-up a resume and prepared a cover letter for the canadian ambassy. And last wednesday, I received this long awaited e-mail.
<br />
<br />
Opened again !

So, this is when it all starts.
