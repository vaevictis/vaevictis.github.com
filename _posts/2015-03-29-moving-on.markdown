A few months later, still no update... Life as moved on. Maybe it's time to formally shut this down. Or at least putting it into an unlimited sleep state.

Last time I updated that page, it was 2 years ago (it's easy to find out, it's written in big fat letters just underneath :) ). Since then, I went to France, Thailand, Australia (I live here, in Melbourne, now...), China (for work), France again, Japan (an amazing place for skiing, at least as good as its reputation).<br />
<br />

I'm going to Tasmania for a week off.
<br />
<br />

I'm dreaming of working on the road.
<br />
<br />

I'm dreaming of building a business.
<br />
<br />

I'm dreaming, anyway :)

Read you later, life memories!
