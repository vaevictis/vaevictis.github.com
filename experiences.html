    <h3>Software Engineer<a href="http://www.boost.co.nz">Boost New Media</a></h3>
    <h4>2012 - current</h4>
    <p>
      Wellington's Agile company of the year. A web development workshop with a very strong accent on agile project management done well. I work full time on the National Library set of applications, mostly <a href="http://digitalnz.org">digitalnz.org</a> and the <a href="http://natlib.govt.nz">National Library of New Zealand</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I work on both front and back ends of the apps, but my heart is on the user side of things, as usual.

    <h3>Software Engineer and Photographer<a href="http://www.enspiral.com">enspiral.com</a></h3>
    <h4>2012 - current</h4>
    <p>
      An unsual place to work... Flat hierarchy network of freelancers, filled with amazing people who work for a better world, but are still conscious of a life's needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mostly contracted for <a href="http://www.chinadialogue.net/">chinadialogue.net</a> a chinese / english billingual news site, in a very internationalized context. Project leader in UK, one developer in Italy, an other one in Saoudi Arabia. Interesting.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      I'm not working as a developer through Enspiral at the moment, but I volunteer as a photographer on some events.

    <h3>Software Engineer<a href="http://www.sogilis.com">sogilis.com</a></h3>
    <h4>2009 to 2012</h4>
    <p>
      Ruby on Rails. Agility. eXtreme Programming. Pair programming. Behaviour Driven Development. All those concepts I had already heard about, but I learned what they really meant there. These guys rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      I developed many applications there. Most noticeably rewriting a 15 years old environmental assessment tool in 18 months, from scratch, in pair with a more seasoned developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the last 6 months, I switched function. I was product owner on a pretty difficult project. I designed the client needs with them through conception sessions, prototypes and mockups and then specified and splitted those needs into stories for the development pairs. I managed up to 6 developers and organized work on up 3 projects at the same time.

    <h3>Frontend Web Developer<a href="http://www.drimki.fr">drimki.fr</a></h3>
    <h4>2008 to 2009</h4>
    <p>
      I worked for a real estate community web site.<br />
      I used symfony (PHP framework) and integrated advanced layouts. Cross-browser compliance, Javascript and CSS at its best, working with JSON web services and integrating SEO needs were my daily soup.<br />
      I did some server-side refactoring too.

    <p>
      At INRIA, a nation-wide computer science research lab, I worked for the communication departement.
    </p>
    <p>I designed, prototyped and developed a web-based digital assets management tool.</p>
    <p>I also developed a web-based helpdesk application with Ruby on Rails.</p>

    <h4>2006 to 2007</h4>
    <p>After considering my passion for computers could become more than a hobby, I embraced a specific one year master programme, covering most crucial parts of the usual 3 year programme. This "année spéciale" is targeted to graduate students who want to open their profile to a different subject.</p>
