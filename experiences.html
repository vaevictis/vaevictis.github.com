		<h3>Software Developer<a href="http://www.sogilis.com">sogilis.com</a></h3>
		<h4>2009 to 2012</h4>
		<p>
			Ruby on Rails. Agility. eXtreme Programming. Pair programming. Behaviour Driven Development. All those concepts I had already heard about, but I learned what they really meant there. These guys rock.
		</p>
		<p>
			I developed many applications there. Most noticeably rewriting a 15 years old environmental assessment tool in 18 months, from scratch, in pair with a senior developer.
		</p>
		<p>
			During the last 6 months, I switched function. I was product owner on a pretty difficult project. I designed the client needs with them through conception sessions, prototypes and mockups and then specified and splitted those needs into stories for the development pairs. I managed up to 6 developers and organized work on up 3 projects at the same time.

		<h3>Frontend Web Developer<a href="http://www.drimki.fr">drimki.fr</a></h3>
		<h4>2008 to 2009</h4>
		<p>
			I worked for a real estate community web site.<br />
			I used symfony (PHP framework) and integrated advanced layouts. Cross-browser compliance, Javascript and CSS at its best, working with JSON web services and integrating SEO needs were my daily soup.<br />
			I did some server-side refactoring too.

		<h4>2006 to 2007</h4>
		<p>After considering my passion for computers could become more than a hobby, I embraced a specific one year programme, covering most crucial parts of the normal 3 year programme. This "année spéciale" is targeted to graduate students who want to open their profile to a different subject.</p>
