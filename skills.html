		<h3>Opinionated Software Developer</h3>
		<p>Once upon a time I was a mechanical engineer. But during my cursus, I fell in love with computers. Since then, I completely switched working branch.
			Today, I'm a seasoned software developer.</p>

			<p>I’ve got strong opinions. Principles, one could say. I’m convinced it’s a quality.</p>
			<p>So, no, I don't like loosy IDEs and working on a Windows workstation. I don’t like Java neither. I'm a convinced Apple geek and expert with Mac OS X, even if I don't mind gaming on a Windows machine or deploying an application on a linux server. But when it comes to developing for the web, I'll go TextMate and command line.</p>

			<p>I love tools. I love when a simple one fits one particular task. and guess what, I know my toolbox.</p>

		<h3>Basket o' techs</h3>
		<p>
			Here's a list of some of the tools I've at least used a few times and considered using again (for quality, speed, ease of use / deployment, elegance, it may vary). I'm mostly motivated by agility / Web development / BDD / UI conception, however, and this list is already obsolete.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Ruby, Rails 2 and 3, Cucumber, Rspec, Git</li>
			<li>CSS and HTML, HAML and Sass</li>
			<li>Adobe Creative Suite, Balsamiq mockups, Omnigraffle, Paper prototyping</li>
			<li>Bash, Apache</li>
			<li>Capistrano, Heroku, Chef</li>
			<li>Cocoa / Obj-C, Sproutcore</li>
			<li>Symfony (PHP), Javascript</li>
		</ul>
