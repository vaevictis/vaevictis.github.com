    <h3>Opinionated Software Developer</h3>
    <p>Once upon a time I was a mechanical engineer. But during the programme, I fell in love with computers. Since then, I completely switched working branch.
      Today, I'm a seasoned software developer.</p>

      <p>I’ve got strong opinions. Principles, one could say. I’m convinced it’s a quality.</p>
      <p>So, no, I don't like loosy IDEs (as in slow and buggy, nothing against IDEs by themselves) and working on a Windows workstation. I'm not a huge fan of Java either. Not that I have a thorough experience with it (far from it), but as a user, all the applications I've used were either slow or creeped by ugly UIs. I'm a convinced Apple geek and expert with Mac OS X, even if I don't mind gaming on a Windows machine or deploying an application on a linux server. But when it comes to developing for the web, I'll go TextMate (Sublime Text, recently!) and command line.</p>

      <p>I love tools. I love when a simple one fits one particular task. and guess what, I know my toolbox.</p>

    <h3>Agility and teamplay</h3>
    <p>
      Process? Yes of course. But please, let's not consider anything is taken for granted. I'm a Certified Scrum Master and advocate of eXtreme Programming practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like sharing what I know and learning from others. I've always worked in an Agile context, with more and more success over the years. I've had a successful first experience as a team manager before coming to New Zealand and am seriously considering exploring this path in the next months / years.

    <h3>Toolbox</h3>
    <p>
      Here's a list of some of the tools I've at least used a few times and considered using again (for quality, speed, ease of use / deployment, elegance, it may vary). I'm mostly motivated by agility / Web development / BDD / UI conception, however, and this list is already obsolete.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ruby, Rails 2 and 3, Cucumber, Rspec, Git</li>
      <li>CSS and HTML, HAML and Sass</li>
      <li>Adobe Creative Suite, Balsamiq mockups, Omnigraffle, Paper prototyping</li>
      <li>Bash, Apache</li>
      <li>Capistrano, Heroku, Chef</li>
      <li>Cocoa / Obj-C</li>
      <li>Javascript, JQuery, Sproutcore</li>
      <li>Symfony (PHP with conventions... Yeay!)</li>
      <li>Jekyll</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Foreign languages</h3>
