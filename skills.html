		<h3>Opinionated Software Developer</h3>
		<p>Once upon a time I was a mechanical engineer. But during my cursus, I fell in love with computers. Since then, I completely switched working branch.
			Today, I'm a seasoned software developer. I was born December 14th, 1981 and yes, I can legally drive a car.</p>

			<p>I hold a Master’s Degree in computer engineering and another one in Mechanical Engineering, both aquired in France.</p>

			<p>I’ve got strong opinions. Principles, one could say. I’m convinced it’s a quality.</p>
			<p>So, no, I don't like loosy IDEs and working on a Windows workstation. I don’t like Java neither. I'm a convinced Apple geek and expert with Mac OS X, even if I don't mind gaming on a Windows machine or deploying an application on a linux server. But when it comes to developing for the web, I'll go TextMate and command line.</p>

			<p>I love tools. I love when a simple one fits one particular task. and guess what, I know my toolbox.</p>
