<h2>Who I am</h2>

<div id="about">
  <p>
    My name’s Guillaume Hammadi. I’m French, early 30s. I write software as a daily job and I’m lucky to be passionate about it.
    When away from keyboard, I most probably ride a mountain bike, charge on a snowboard in some deep fresh snow or hanging somewhere in the mountains.
  </p>  

  <p>
    I'm passionate by a lot of things. One of them is Photography. You can have a look at <a href="http://vaevictis.smugmug.com/Landscape/first-year-in-nz/27287458_TLLXGc#!i=2293059108&k=hqH9db7">my 10 favorite shots of New Zealand landscape</a>
    
  </p>

  <p>
    I hold a Master’s Degree in computer engineering and another one in Mechanical Engineering, both aquired in France.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I was a student, I had one dream: I wanted to spend a year in Sweden. Well, I did it. And enjoyed it much!
    I came back in France in 2004. Since then, I’ve had one desire.
  </p>
  <p>
    Leave again. This desire is now live, and here is my story.
