<h2>Who I am</h2>

<div id="about">
	<p>
		My name’s Guillaume Hammadi. I’m French, 29 year old as of today. I write software as a daily job and I’m lucky to be passionate by it.
		When away from keyboard, I’m most probably riding a mountain bike, charging on a snowboard in some deep fresh snow or hanging somewhere in the mountains.
	</p>

	<p>
		I hold a Master’s Degree in computer engineering and another one in Mechanical Engineering, both aquired in France.
	</p>

	<p>
		When I was a student, I had one dream: I wanted to spend a year in Sweden. Well, I did it. And enjoyed it much !
		I came back in France in 2004. Since then, I’ve had one desire.
	</p>
	<p>
		Leave again.
