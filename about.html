<h2>Well, you want to know who I am...</h2>

<div id="about">
	<p>
		My name’s Guillaume Hammadi. I’m French, 29 year old as of today. I write software as a daily job and I’m lucky to be passionate by it.
		When away from keyboard, I’m most probably riding a mountain bike, charging on a snowboard in some deep fresh snow or hanging somewhere in the mountains (no pun intended).
	</p>

	<p>
		When I was a student, I had one dream. I wanted to spend a year in Sweden. Well, I did it. And enjoyed it much !
		I came back in France in 2004. Since then, I’ve had one desire.
	</p>
	<p>
		Leave again.
	</p>
	<p>
		That’s it.<br />
		This time it’s Canada, and I’m not a student anymore.<br />
		<br />
		This is my story.
